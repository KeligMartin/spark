# PYSPARK

To launch the project, you will need to install all dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file.

Then, install the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dhruvildave/github-commit-messages-dataset) and the [stopword list](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/stopword-lists-for-19-languages?select=englishST.txt)

Once everything is done, run `pyspark < main.py`
